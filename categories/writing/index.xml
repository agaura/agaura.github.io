      <description>Hey there! I&amp;rsquo;m a software developer with a focus on imaging, color management, and visualization. I graduated from a master&amp;rsquo;s program in Imaging and Light in Extended Reality in 2022 and received my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Mathematics from Princeton University in 2020.&#xA;This website mostly functions as a way for me to teach myself and strengthen my understanding of what I like to study, as well as provide a space in which some of my projects can live.</description>
