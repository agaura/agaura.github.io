      <description>Introduction There was a very interesting article I came across that I highly recommend discussing the gamma function that addressed color mixing. Essentially: color mixing is often done inaccurately. For example, if you mix two sRGB colors by just averaging them, that color will not be the same color as if you just shined two flashlights of those colors (at 50% brightness) and overlapped them. This is because sRGB colors do not represent the amount of red, green, and blue light you need to mix a color.</description>

      <description>Introduction In the background of this page you can see an invisible sprite leaving a trail of multi-colored ‚Äúsmoke.‚Äù Feel free to click and drag on the page itself, your cursor will also give off colored smoke. The experience works in both light and dark mode but is best viewed in dark mode, so click the ‚ö™Ô∏è/‚ö´Ô∏è button to switch. Scroll down for an empty area to interact with the smoke and for information on the settings.</description>

      <description>Introduction It‚Äôs quite common to see an image or to want to have an image in grayscale. What is it that we are doing when we have a grayscale image? We are deleting two dimensions‚Äîhue and saturation‚Äîfrom the color space representing our image. However, why cannot/why don‚Äôt we delete the other dimensions? Why is this the only standard operation?&#xA;The problem at the heart of the matter here is that there is not a good way to do it.</description>

      <title>Dithering-Based Comparison of Cylindrical Color Spaces</title>

      <description>Introduction Here we are using a dithering method to analyze the differences between three color spaces, namely HSL, Okhsl, and CIELch. The strategy being used is similar to that deployed here, but there is one major difference. Here, when we dither our colors, we are not anihilating any specific one, but rather, all of them. Borrowing the notation from that post, we have that for every color $c$:&#xA;$$P(\hat{c}=c_\theta|t) = 0.</description>

      <description>Introduction This shader is demonstrating what it would look like to remove a portion of the color wheel. The inspiration? I just don&amp;rsquo;t like the color green (ü§Æ) and wanted to get rid of it‚Ä¶ however, this gave me the inspiration to see what it would look like if I could optionally remove any color by removing a sector from the color wheel. So now, with this shader, we can see what that would look like when looking directly at a color wheel.</description>

      <description>Introduction This shader displays images with a portion of the color wheel being impossible to show, instead being displayed as noise being dithered so as to approximate that color. For more information, see here.&#xA;Shader ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Upload Controls ‚ñ∂Ô∏è/‚è∏ Button: Controls time, causes noisiness to evolve over time and smoothens dither Slider: Controls the annihilated hue. Runs counterclockwise starting from the rightmost point of the color wheel (red/hot pink) Slider: Controls with width of the sector being annihilated, where the percentage corresponding to the percentage of the color wheel within that sector, centered around the annihilated hue as defined by the above slider Slider: Changes the size of the resolution of the dithered annihilated colors Discussion This shader more-or-less functions as a fun little artistic thingy.</description>
